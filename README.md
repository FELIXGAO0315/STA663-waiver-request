# STA663-waiver-request

# Introduction：
My supporting materials include Python-based projects and relevant Python-based courses with great grades: 
As you can see in the WES report: 
Intro to financial modelling : A
Intro to financial engineering : A
Foundations of financial computing : A
I also have courses : statistical modelling and statistical methods which are all A

This repository contains a selection of my projects. Please check my materials in folders which contain projects description and code. If I can waive STA663, I want to take courses like advanced machine learning and deep learning to improve my ability and my qualificationsalign with the STA 663 syllabus in the following key areas.

# Project 1 ML with finance
## Project Overview

This project applies Python-based data analysis and machine learning techniques to model and analyze financial asset returns. The workflow covers data preprocessing, return computation, feature construction, model training, evaluation, and visualization. The project emphasizes reproducible workflows, computational efficiency, and interpretability of results.
