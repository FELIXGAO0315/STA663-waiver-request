# STA663-waiver-request

# Introduction：
My supporting materials include Python-based projects and relevant Python-based courses with great grades: 
As you can see in the WES report: 
Intro to financial modelling : A
Intro to financial engineering : A
Foundations of financial computing : A
I also have courses : statistical modelling and statistical methods which are all A

This repository contains a selection of my projects. Please check my materials in folders which contain projects description and code. If I can waive STA663, I want to take courses like advanced machine learning and deep learning to improve my ability and my qualificationsalign with the STA 663 syllabus in the following key areas.

# Project 1 ML with finance
This project focuses on applying Python-based data analysis and machine learning techniques to financial time series modeling. The primary objective is to preprocess asset price data, compute returns, and build predictive models to analyze and forecast financial behavior. The project follows a complete data science pipeline, including data cleaning, feature construction, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

Using Python, raw price data are transformed into returns and structured into tabular form for analysis. Exploratory data analysis and visualization are conducted to understand distributional properties and temporal patterns. Machine learning models are then implemented to predict returns, with model performance assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics and cross-validation strategies. The project emphasizes reproducible workflows, computational efficiency, and interpretability of results.
